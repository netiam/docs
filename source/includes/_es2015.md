# ES2015

This library uses ES2015 syntax and in some places ES7 syntax too (async/await).
Be aware that this library is compiled into ES5 comaptible JavaScript code
before it is deployed as npm package.

The documentation might always use ES2015 syntax. If you plan to use the library
within another Babel project, you should consider using the `babel-runtime` as
it is already required by the `netiam` package.
